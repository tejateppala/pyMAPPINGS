Welcome to pyMAPPINGS's documentation!
======================================

**pyMAPPINGS** is a Python library for the MAPPINGS V photoionization and shock modeling code. It simplifies the process of running models, parsing output, and visualizing results â€” all from Python.
The MAPPINGS photoionization project began in 1976, led by Michael Dopita.
Since the 1980s, MAPPINGS have been re-written and maintained by Ralph Sutherland.
